Does the implementation matter?

# Context

##  Tango v10 and CORBA, already in 2013 (ICALEPCS Talk)
##  Experimentation of other RPC protocol
##  The Tango kernel meeting at Solaris, Poland.

#- CORBA
.pull-left[
# Common Object Request Broker Architecture
 - Distributed Protocol
 - Object oriented
 - Language agnostic
 - Use an Interface Definition Language
 - Standard since 1991

Several generation of distributed follow up till Micro Services]
.pull-right[

#- CORBA

# Suit perfectly Tango
 - Distributed Protocol
 - Device oriented
 - Language agnostic

# ... or Tango inspired by CORBA

Tango Device was just a specific CORBA Object.

You were supposed to use raw CORBA to access/expose a Tango device. The libtango was just an helper.

One reason why it's so hard to replace CORBA.

---
#- CORBA
# ... but the relationship started to be more complex
The usage of CORBA changed by the time with a mix of RPC
  - Dserver
  - read/write several attributes at the same time
  - ...

Another reason why it so hard to replace CORBA.

---
#- CORBA
# So what define Tango at the end?

At the Tango kernel meeting there was a lot of discussion of Tango v10:
 - new architecture to abstract the protocol and more
 - backward compatibility

Andy commented to define specification before development.
Lorenzo gave this great idea to look at ZeroMQ.

---
#- The ZeroMQ specification
##  ABNF Augmented Backus-Naur form
Formal definition for protocol
``` ABNF
device-name = domain "/" family "/" member
domain = 1*VCHAR
family = 1*VCHAR
member = 1*VCHAR
```

## [C4](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4/) is the change process
- Collective Code Construction Contract
- Each specfication has an editor
- Modification can be done by merge request in draft mode.

---
#- The ZeroMQ specification
## [Consensus Oriented Specification System](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/)

A way to define specification that is:
- simple
- open, shareable
- collaborative

It avoid to turn the specification proprietary by introducing key component (protected by patent).

If you don't like it, fork it.

It allows to track changes in specification

---
#- Tango RFC Proposition

## Proposition to use the same specification system as ZeroMQ

## A prototype of Tango specification [tango-rfc](https://gitlab.com/MaxIV/tango-rfc).

Guide of implementation is just to guarantee the interoperability
 - Need to Guarantee the behaviour of client and server
 - Propose different scenarii of compatibility.

## One specification, several implementation
What are the fundamentals to make a new implementation of Tango?

We can think that Tango can be implemented in the same language but with a different architecture but still stay compatible. (consistency over entry cost level)

# The Tango Specification

Don't bother with boring beach, join us this summer

---
# The Tango Specification

## Goal
- Focus on V9 to understand the change for V10
- Need volunteer: Editors, Writers

## Timeline 3-6 months
- budget for help writing the specification
- budget after for writing a first new C++ implementation 

---
# The Mascot project
.pull-left[
## Investigation with GRPC.
- The enums and structure are part of the IDL. That may be one reason why CORBA is so into the C++ implementation 
- Should we implement the wire protocol ourselves?
- Is there a tango protocol?
- Should we enforce the same name of class/enum in different implementation? Dev...

On the client side:
- Is the TangoDatabase and admin device are only a client abstraction?
